 ## STREAMS PIPES AND LISTS (Exercise 6 of 11)  
   
  This exercise is very important because streams, pipes, and lists of  
  commands are used everywhere. You will meet these strange > and |  
  characters in almost any script. So let's discover the secret to what they  
  exactly are.  
   
 ### Streams  
   
  Bash receives input and sends output as sequences or streams of  
  characters.  These streams may be redirected into files or vice versa.  
   
  There are three descriptors:  
   
 Code Descriptor Description  
 ---- ---------- --------------------  
   0     stdin   The standard input.  
   1    stdout   The standard output.  
   2    stderr   The errors output.  
   
  Redirection makes it possible to control where the output of a command  
  goes to, and where the input of a command comes from. For redirecting  
  streams these operators are used:  
   
 Operator Description  
 -------- --------------------------------------------------------------------  
     >    Redirecting output  
    &>    Redirecting output and error output  
    &>>   Appending redirected output and error output  
     <    Redirecting input  
    <<    [Here documents](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) syntax  
    <<<   [Here strings](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17837.html)  
   
  Here are a few examples of using redirections:  
   
     # output of ls will be written to list.txt  
     ls -l > list.txt  
       
     # append output to list.txt  
     ls -a >> list.txt  
       
     # all errors will be written to errors.txt  
     grep da * 2> errors.txt  
       
     # read from errors.txt  
     less < errors.txt  
   
 ### Pipes  
   
  We could redirect standard streams not only in files, but also to other  
  programs. Pipes let us use the output of a program as the input of  
  another.  
   
  In the example below, command1 sends its output to command2, which then  
  passes it on to the input of command3:  
   
     command1 | command2 | command3  
   
  Constructions like this are called pipelines.  
   
  In practice, this can be used to process data through several programs.  
  For example, here the output of ls -l is sent to the grep program, which  
  prints only files with a .md extension, and this output is finally sent to  
  the less program:  
   
     ls -l | grep .md$ | less  
   
 ### Lists of commands  
   
  A list of commands is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by ;,  
  &, && or || operator.  
   
  If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes  
  the command asynchronously in a subshell. In other words, this command  
  will be executing in the background.  
   
  Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially: one after another.  
  The shell waits for the finish of each command.  
   
     # command2 will be executed after command1  
     command1 ; command2  
       
     # which is the same as  
     command1  
     command2  
   
  Lists separated by && and || are called AND and OR lists, respectively.  
   
  The AND-list looks like this:  
   
     # command2 will be executed if, and only if, command1 finishes successfully (returns 0 exit status)  
     command1 && command2  
   
  The OR-list has the form:  
   
     # command2 will be executed if, and only if, command finishes unsuccessfully (returns code of error)  
     command1 || command2  
   
  The return code of AND and OR lists the exit status of the last executed  
  command.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named lists.bash.  
   
  Using lists of commands (&, &&, || or ;) output First parameter is false.  
  if the first positional parameter is false, the path to the current  
  directory if the second parameter is true; if third parameter is true  
  output the list of files in the current directory or Third parameter is  
  false. if it is false.  
   
  For example:  
   
     ./lists.bash true true false  
   
  Output:  
   
     ~/Projects/bash-exercices.  
     Third parameter is false.
