  Welcome in learnyoubash!  
   
  This workshopper is completely based on the bash-handbook:  
   
  <https://github.com/denysdovhan/bash-handbook>  
   
 ### What is Bash?  
   
  Bash is a Unix shell written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free  
  software replacement for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wiki  
  pedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell). It was released in 1989 and has been  
  distributed as the Linux and OS X default shell for a long time. Today,  
  Bash is one of the most powerful and portable tools for writing efficient  
  scripts for all Unix-based systems. So let's get started!  
   
 ### Interactive and non-interactive modes  
   
  Bash may work in two different modes: interactive and non-interactive.  
   
  Just now you're interacting with this workshopper using commands, for  
  example learnyoubash. This is an interactive mode. Here you can enter a  
  variety of Unix commands, such as ls, grep, cd, mkdir, rm and see the  
  result of their execution.  
   
  In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from a file or a pipe  
  and executes them. The exercises in this workshopper will teach you how to  
  write simple scripts using Bash.  
   
 ### What is the script?  
   
  A script is just a regular text file that consists of commands the shell  
  interpreter can evaluate using bash shell's interpreter program. The  
  commands are just regular command which you can use from interactive mode  
  too.  
   
  Create your first script using the touch command:  
   
     touch hi.bash  
   
  The touch command creates an empty file in your current directory.  
   
  Now you can simplify invoking the script by making it an executable file  
  using the chmod command:  
   
     chmod +x hi.bash  
   
  Additionally, the first line in the script must indicate which program it  
  should use to run the file, like so:  
   
     #!/usr/bin/env bash  
       
     echo "Hi!"  
   
  This #!/usr/bin/env bash character sequence is known as the  
  [shebang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29). Now you can  
  run script like this:  
   
     ./hi.bash  
   
  Another handy thing we learned above is using the echo to print something  
  to the terminal screen.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named hello.bash (prefer to use touch).  
   
  That file should contain a command which outputs:  
   
     Hello, world!
