 ## CASE CONDITIONAL STATEMENT (Exercise 8 of 11)  
   
  If you are confronted with a couple of different possible actions to take,  
  then using a case statement may be more useful than nested if statements.  
  For more complex conditions use a case statement like below:  
   
     case "$FRUIT" in  
       (apple)  
         echo 'Mmmmh... I like apple!'  
         ;;  
       (banana)  
         echo 'Hm, a bit awry, no?'  
         ;;  
       (orange|tangerine)  
         echo "I don't like it!" && exit 1  
       ;;  
       (*)  
         echo "Unknown fruit - sure it isn't toxic?"  
       ;;  
     esac  
   
  Each case is an expression matching a pattern. The | sign is used for  
  separating multiple patterns, and the ) operator terminates a pattern  
  list. The commands for the first match are executed. * is the pattern for  
  anything else that doesn't match the defined patterns. Each block of  
  commands should be divided with the ;; operator.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named case.bash.  
   
  In this exercise you will create a small image extensions checker. Using a  
  case statement, check if the first positional parameter is a jpeg (or  
  jpg), png, or gif extension. Output It is jpeg., It is png., or It is gif.  
  accordingly. Take care about cases when the positional argument contains  
  any other extension (print [EXT] is not an image! in these cases).  
   
  For example:  
   
     ./case.bash png  
     ./case.bash js  
     ./case.bash jpg  
   
  Output:  
   
     It is png.  
     js is not an image!  
     It is jpeg.
