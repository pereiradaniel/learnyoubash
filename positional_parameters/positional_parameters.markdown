 ## POSITIONAL PARAMETERS (Exercise 3 of 11)  
   
  Now you already know how to define local and environment variables. But  
  what are you going to use when you need to get parameters from the  
  outside? For those purposes you may use positional parameters.  
   
  Positional parameters are variables allocated when a function is evaluated  
  and they are given positionally. The following table lists positional  
  parameter variables and other special variables and their meanings when  
  you are inside a function.  
   
 Parameter    Description  
 ------------ -------------------------------------------------------  
 $0           Script's name.  
 $1 … $9      The parameter list elements from 1 to 9.  
 ${10} … ${N} The parameter list elements from 10 to N.  
 $* or $@     All positional parameters except $0.  
 $#           The number of parameters, not counting $0.  
 $FUNCNAME    The function name (has a value only inside a function).  
   
  In the example below, the positional parameters will be $0='./script.sh',  
  $1='foo' and $2='bar':  
   
     ./script.sh foo bar  
   
 ### Default values  
   
  Variables may also have default values. We can define them as such using  
  the following syntax:  
   
     # Assign FOO value 'default' if it's empty  
     FOO=${FOO:-'default'}  
   
  Default values may be useful when you should process the positional  
  parameters, which could be omitted.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named parameters.bash.  
   
  Your program should output only the first, third and fifth positional  
  parameters, which will be passed into your script. Before each argument  
  must be its sequence number with a colon :. Every parameter must be  
  outputted on separate lines.  
   
  For example, if you run the script like so:  
   
     ./parameters.bash one two three four five six seven  
   
  The output must look like the following:  
   
     1: one  
     3: three  
     5: five  
   
  Do not pass any arguments to your solution; when you try to verify or run  
  your script using learnyoubash, we will pass the arguments automatically.
