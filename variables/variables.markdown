 # Learn Bash  
   
 ## VARIABLES (Exercise 2 of 11)  
   
  Like in most programming languages, you can also create variables in bash.  
   
  Bash knows no data types. Variables can contain only numbers or a string  
  of one or more characters. There are three kinds of variables you can  
  create: local variables, environment variables and variables as positional  
  arguments.  
   
 ### Local variables  
   
  Local variables are variables that exist only within a single script. They  
  are inaccessible to other programs and scripts. A local variable can be  
  declared using = sign (as a rule, there should not be any spaces between a  
  variable's name, = and its value) and its value can be retrieved using the  
  $ sign. For example:  
   
     foo="value"  # declare variable  
     echo $foo    # display value  
     unset foo    # delete variable  
   
  The variables can be used inside strings. But there is an important  
  difference between double and single quotes. Inside double quotes  
  variables are expanded. Inside single quotes they are not. For example:  
   
     NAME="Denys"  
     echo "My name is $NAME" #> My name is Denys  
     echo 'My name is $NAME' #> My name is $NAME  
   
 ### Environment variables  
   
  Sometimes we need to declare variables which will be accessible from  
  outside the current shell session, for other programs, scripts, etc. These  
  variables are called environment variables. They are created just like  
  local variables, but using the keyword export instead.  
   
     export GLOBAL_VAR="I am a global variable"  
   
  There are a lot of global variables in bash. You will meet these variables  
  fairly often, so here is a quick lookup table with the most practical  
  ones:  
   
 Variable Description  
 -------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 $HOME    The current user's home directory.  
 $USER    The current user.  
 $PATH    A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.  
 $PWD     The current working directory.  
 $RANDOM  Random integer between 0 and 32767.  
 $UID     The numeric, real user ID of the current user.  
 $PS1     The primary prompt string.  
 $PS2     The secondary prompt string.  
   
  You may find extended list of environment variables in Bash:

 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named variables.bash (of course using touch).  
   
  Your program should output your current username and directory name in the  
  following format:  
   
     User <username> in directory <directory>.
