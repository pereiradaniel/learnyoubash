 ## LOOPS (Exercise 9 of 11)  
   
  Here we won't be surprised. As in any programming language, a loop in bash  
  is a block of code that iterates as long as the control conditional is  
  true.  
   
  There are four types of loops in Bash: for, while, until and select.  
   
 ### for loop  
   
  The for loop is very similar to its sibling in C. It looks like this:  
   
     for arg in elem1 elem2 ... elemN  
     do  
       # statements  
     done  
   
  During each pass through the loop, arg takes on the value from elem1 to  
  elemN. Values may also be wildcards or [brace  
  expansion](#brace-expansion).  
   
  Also, we can write a for loop in one line, but in this case there needs to  
  be a semicolon before do, like below:  
   
     for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done  
   
  By the way, if for..in..do seems a little bit weird to you, you can also  
  write for in C-like style such as:  
   
     for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do  
       echo $i  
     done  
   
  for is handy when we want to do the same operation over each file in a  
  directory. For example, if we need to move all .bash files into the script  
  folder and then give them execute permissions, our script would look like  
  this:  
   
     #!/bin/bash  
       
     for FILE in $HOME/*.bash; do  
       mv "$FILE" "${HOME}/scripts"  
       chmod +x "${HOME}/scripts/${FILE}"  
     done  
   
 ### while loop  
   
  The while loop tests a condition and loops a sequence of commands so long  
  as that condition is true. A condition is nothing more than the primary  
  used in if..then conditions. So a working example with while loop might  
  look like this:  
   
     #!/bin/bash  
       
     # Squares of numbers from 0 through 9  
     x=0  
     while [[ $x -lt 10 ]]; do # value of x is less than 10  
       echo $(($x * $x))  
       x=`expr $x + 1` # increase x  
     done  
   
  Just like in the case of the for loop, if we want to write do and the  
  condition in the same line, then we must use a semicolon before do.  
   
 ### until loop  
   
  The until loop is the exact opposite of the while loop. Like a while loop  
  it checks a test condition, but it keeps looping as long as this condition  
  is false:  
   
     until [[ condition ]]; do  
       #statements  
     done  
   
 ### Loop control  
   
  There are situations when we need to stop a loop before its normal ending  
  or step over an iteration. In these cases, we can use the shell built-in  
  break and continue statements. Both of these work with every kind of loop.  
   
  The break statement is used to exit the current loop before its ending.  
   
  The continue statement steps over one iteration. We can use it as such:  
   
     for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )); do  
       if [[ $(($i % 2)) == 0 ]]; then continue; fi  
       echo $i  
     done  
   
  If we run the example above, it will print all odd numbers from 0 through  
  9.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named loops.bash.  
   
  The first two positional parameters which will be passed into your script  
  are the limits. You should write all even numbers in the range between the  
  first and second positional parameters.  
   
  Example:  
   
     ./loops.bash 10 17  
   
  Output:  
   
     10  
     12  
     14  
     16  
   
  Use for, while or until loops to solve this problem.
