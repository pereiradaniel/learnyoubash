 ## SHELL EXPANSIONS (Exercise 5 of 11)  
   
  Expansions  are a mechanism to calculate arithmetical operations, to save  
  results of command's executions and so on.  
   
  If you are interested, you can read [more about shell  
  expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Expan  
  sions).  
   
 ### Brace expansion  
   
  Brace expansions allow us to generate arbitrary strings. It's similar to  
  filename expansion. For example:  
   
     echo beg{i,a,u}n # begin began begun  
   
  Also brace expansions may be used for creating ranges, which are iterated  
  over in loops.  
   
     echo {0..5} # 0 1 2 3 4 5  
     echo {00..8..2} # 00 02 04 06 08  
   
 ### Command substitution  
   
  Command substitution allow us to evaluate a command and substitute its  
  value into another command or variable assignment. Command substitution is  
  performed when a command is enclosed by ``  or $().  For example, we can  
  use it as follows:  
   
     now=`date +%T`  
     # or  
     now=$(date +%T)  
       
     echo $now # 19:08:26  
   
 ### Arithmetic expansion  
   
  In bash we are free to do any arithmetic operations. But the expression  
  must be enclosed by $(( )). The format for arithmetic expansions is:  
   
     result=$(( ((10 + 5*3) - 7) / 2 ))  
     echo $result # 9  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named expansions.bash.  
   
  Your script should multiply the first positional parameter with the sum of  
  the second and third parameter using arithmetic expansion. Save the result  
  to the variable, $RESULT e.g.  
   
  Then, using brace expansions, restore the following folder structure:  
   
     project-<RESULT>  
     ├── dest  
     │   ├── index.js  
     │   └── util.js  
     ├── src  
     │   ├── index.js  
     │   └── util.js  
     └── test  
         ├── index.js  
         └── util.js  
   
  Do not create any folders! Just output the result using echo. For example:  
   
     ./expansions.bash 1 5 6  
   
  The result must looks like this:  
   
     project-11/src/index.js  
     project-11/src/util.js  
     project-11/dest/index.js  
     project-11/dest/util.js  
     project-11/test/index.js  
     project-11/test/util.js
