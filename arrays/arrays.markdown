 ## ARRAYS (Exercise 4 of 11)  
   
  If you are already familiar with arrays in other programming languages,  
  you won't be surprised here.  
   
  An array in bash is a variable that allows you to refer to multiple  
  values. In bash, arrays are also zero-based, that is, the first element in  
  an array has an index of 0.  
   
  When dealing with arrays, we should be aware of the special environment  
  variable IFS. IFS or Input Field Separator â€” is the character that  
  separates elements in an array. The default value is an empty space IFS='  
  '.  
   
 ### Array declaration  
   
  In bash you create an array by simply assigning a value to an index in the  
  array variable:  
   
     fruits[0]=Apple  
     fruits[1]=Pear  
     fruits[2]=Plum  
     echo ${fruits[*]} # echo ${fruits[@]} may be used as well  
   
  Array variables can also be created using compound assignments such as:  
   
     fruits=(Apple Pear Plum)  
   
 ### Array slice  
   
  Also, we can extract a slice of an array using the slice operators:  
   
     echo ${fruits[*]:0:2} # Apple Pear  
     echo ${@:1:2} # slice of positional parameters  
   
  In the example above, fruits[*] returns the entire contents of the array,  
  and :0:2 extracts the slice of length 2, that starts at index 0.  
   
 ### Adding elements into an array  
   
  Adding elements into an array is quite simple too. Compound assignments  
  are specially useful in this case. We can use them like this:  
   
     fruits=(Orange ${fruits[*]} Banana Cherry)  
     echo ${fruits[*]} # Orange Apple Pear Plum Banana Cherry  
   
  In the example above, fruits[*] represents the entire contents of the  
  array and substitutes it into the compound assignment, then assigns the  
  new value into the fruits array, mutating its original value.  
   
 ### Deleting elements from an array  
   
  To delete an element from an array, use the unset command:  
   
     unset fruits[0]  
     echo ${fruits[*]} # Apple Pear Plum Banana Cherry  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a file named arrays.bash.  
   
  A few values will be passed into your script through positional  
  parameters. As you already know, all parameters which were passed into the  
  script are stored in $* and $@ variables. These variables are none other  
  than arrays.  
   
  You should take slice of elements consisting of the second to third items  
  (eventually two items). Save these elements into a new array. Add to the  
  beginning of the array two new items, I and am. Add to the end of the  
  array two items: and and the fourth positional argument.  
   
  Output all elements of the array.  
   
  For example, if you run your script with these arguments:  
   
     ./arrays.bash awesome cool strong cute awesome  
   
  The script must output this:  
   
     I am cool strong and cute
